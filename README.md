Creating basic mechanic of a modified chess. Inspired by Heroes Might and Magic. For learning purpose.
For real, this is just for learning.

Creating basic mechanic like pawn movement, input validation, and random generator for attack/defense. This project also my first use OOP in python. No winning-check yet.

Choose between 3 classes: Gladiator, Guardian, and Ninja. Gladiator has higher chance to kill enemies, Guardian has higher chance of defending themself, and Ninja can move 2 blocks at a time.
After completing this small project, i'll add UI, more maps, more game mechanics, and many more!
